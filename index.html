As I write this, I&rsquo;m on a flight from Seattle to Salt Lake City (first of a connection). I enjoy the fact that I can connect to the internet while going over 500 MPH at nearly 30,000 feet in the air - it&rsquo;s a wonder of science that I can do these things. However, sometimes the cost of getting the in-flight internet is a little over-the-top. Most of the time, I&rsquo;ll connect to the hotspot, but then use my laptop offline (http://devdocs.io offline mode is perfect for this). ...</section></article><article class="post"><header class="post-header"><span class="post-meta"><date datetime="Sun, 31 Jan 2016">Sun, 31 Jan 2016</date><div class="tags"><a href="/tags/Tools.html" style="padding: 0 0.5rem 0 0;">Tools</a><a href="/tags/Metablog.html" style="padding: 0 0.5rem 0 0;">Metablog</a><a href="/tags/Systems.html" style="padding: 0 0.5rem 0 0;">Systems</a><a href="/tags/Linux.html" style="padding: 0 0.5rem 0 0;">Linux</a></div></span><h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://www.ballpointcarrot.net/posts/exploring-nixos.html">Exploring Nixos</a></h2></header><section class="post-excerpt">Late-ish last year (around November, if memory serves), I read about a new OS project which allowed its users a stark departure from traditional Linux methods. Called Nixos, the unique claim that it brought to the table was that the system configuration was managed declaratively, through functional configuration files. This includes things like package management, services executed, and user configuration. To fit along with my foray into the world of functional programming (my jumps into Rust starting a mental shift, and recent dives into Clojure sealing the deal), I wanted to give it a shot. There were a couple of...</section></article><article class="post"><header class="post-header"><span class="post-meta"><date datetime="Tue, 8 Sep 2015">Tue, 8 Sep 2015</date><div class="tags"><a href="/tags/Metablog.html" style="padding: 0 0.5rem 0 0;">Metablog</a><a href="/tags/Systems.html" style="padding: 0 0.5rem 0 0;">Systems</a><a href="/tags/Whoops.html" style="padding: 0 0.5rem 0 0;">Whoops</a></div></span><h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://www.ballpointcarrot.net/posts/im-still-here.html">I'm Still Here / Careless Copying</a></h2></header><section class="post-excerpt">I&rsquo;ve identified that a considerable time has gone by since the last update. I&rsquo;m going to put some adequate time into resolving that this month and into the future. I&rsquo;ve been sitting on a couple of topics that I want to dig into (regarding how I handle email and some work I&rsquo;ve been doing with Clojure). In the interim, I&rsquo;ll leave you with a little anecdote/tale of caution.  My wife and I (oh yeah, by the way, I got married in April. I really need to work on updates.) frequently play video games together to pass the time.

At first, the best resource for these was Project Euler, but as time went on, new projects came about that presented problems in slightly different ways:  Codewars gamifies the process a bit, by rating the difficulty of each item; those determine the amount of credit you get by solving them. CodeKata, which is more of an exercise in repeated solutions to common problems, with the understanding that the repeated practice, you become...</section></article><article class="post"><header class="post-header"><span class="post-meta"><date datetime="Sat, 7 Mar 2015">Sat, 7 Mar 2015</date><div class="tags"><a href="/tags/rust.html" style="padding: 0 0.5rem 0 0;">rust</a><a href="/tags/Programming.html" style="padding: 0 0.5rem 0 0;">Programming</a></div></span><h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://www.ballpointcarrot.net/posts/rust-non-systems-programmer.html">Rust, by a non-systems programmer (Part 1 of n)</a></h2></header><section class="post-excerpt">I&rsquo;ve been working on trying to teach myself Rust for the past 4 months or so. It&rsquo;s been slow-going, because I&rsquo;m having to teach myself things that would have been common knowledge for anyone with previous experience doing systems-level programming in C or C++. Instead, this will be more or less of a brain dump of a rubyist that is picking up some systems-level knowledge. String I/O Coming from a scripting language like Ruby, basic string input and output is fairly straightforward: puts &quot;How old are you?&quot; age = gets.strip puts &quot;You've said #{age} years, which is #{(age.to_i*365.25).to_i} days.&quot; ...</section></article><div class="pagination"><a href="/archive.html">Archives</a><a href="/tags.html">Tags</a></div></main><footer class="site-footer"><a class="subscribe icon-feed" href="http://www.ballpointcarrot.net/atom.xml"><span class="tooltip">Subscribe!</span></a><div class="inner"><section class="copyright">All content copyright <a href="http://www.ballpointcarrot.net/">Ballpointcarrot.net</a> &copy; 2017 &bull; All rights reserved.</section></div></footer><script src="/assets/js/index.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="/assets/js/prism.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html>
