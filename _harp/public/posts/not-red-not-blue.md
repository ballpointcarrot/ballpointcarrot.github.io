So, as you may have noticed, I don't blog all that much. What you don't see, however, is that I'm not happy that I don't blog much.

I struggle with the fact that I feel I don't produce enough. In a profession where people are "makers," I do far too much "consuming" instead. Even something like a blog post is an effor to get ideas that are normally internalized out to the world as a whole; normally these efforts fall to the wayside, though, and I end up content to just consume what's out there. I mean, hey - if I don't put my thoughts out there, nobody can criticize them, so it's safer, right?

But then 2016 happened, with all its tragic loss, surprise outcomes, and internalized outrage.

As we approach the end of the year, and with grave uncertainty and a perverse dread as to what a Trump-led 2017 brings us, I want to - no, I *need* to - get some of my frustrations out of my own head. The crux of the following argument is this: I'm a complex being, and I have complex ideals - I shouldn't be categorized into "red" or "blue." I want a political system where I feel like I have the opportunity to choose someone who actually approaches those ideals.
