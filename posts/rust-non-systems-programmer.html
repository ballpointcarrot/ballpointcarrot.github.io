        <h1 class="post-title">Rust, by a non-systems programmer (Part 1 of n)</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            <p>I&#39;ve been working on trying to teach myself Rust for the past 4 months or so. It&#39;s been slow-going, because I&#39;m having to
teach myself things that would have been common knowledge for anyone with previous experience doing systems-level programming
in C or C++. Instead, this will be more or less of a brain dump of a rubyist that is picking up some systems-level knowledge.</p>
<h2>String I/O</h2><p>Coming from a scripting language like Ruby, basic string input and output is fairly straightforward:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">puts &quot;How old are you?&quot;
age = gets.strip
puts &quot;You&#39;ve said #{age} years, which is #{(age.to_i*365.25).to_i} days.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>In Rust, this becomes significantly more involved:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">#![feature(old_io)]
use std::old_io::stdin;
use std::str::FromStr;

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;How old are you?&quot;);
    let mut input = match stdin().read_line() {
        Ok(v) =&gt; v,
        Err(_) =&gt; panic!(&quot;Couldn&#39;t get STDIN!&quot;)
    };
    input = input.trim()
    let age_days:usize = match FromStr::from_str(input.trim()) {
        Ok(v) =&gt; (v * 365.25) as usize,
        Err(_) =&gt; panic!(&quot;Couldn&#39;t convert to usize!&quot;)
    };

    println!(&quot;You&#39;ve said {} years, which is {} days&quot;, input.trim(), age_days)
}
</code></pre>
<p>In Rust, the placement of the variable in stack or heap memory is important to the Rust compiler&#39;s understanding of</p>
<ul>
<li>how long the variable lives (it&#39;s &quot;lifetime&quot;), and</li>
<li>who owns the memory that the variable uses (the &quot;ownership&quot;).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ownership.html">plenty</a> 
<a href="http://rustbyexample.com/move.html">of</a> 
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/strings.html">posts</a>
<a href="http://nercury.github.io/rust/guide/2015/01/19/ownership.html">available</a>
which will explain these terms to enough detail; for practical purposes, we have to manage two separate types of strings. 
Each type gets used in subtly different ways, but will cause you some problems when building out programs. </p>
<p>The more commonly used string type is <code>&amp;str</code>, also known as the &quot;string slice&quot;. This string is allocated to the stack, and
is accessed through a reference to the stored string, much like a C-like character array.</p>
<p>The second string type, <code>String</code>, is used when you want to maintain ownership over the string value. <code>String</code>s are allocated on the heap, and
are &quot;growable&quot; - that is, they can be added to as mutable variables. </p>
<p>Be careful to understand what type of string you&#39;ll be dealing with; functions generally operate on the more general <code>&amp;str</code> type,
so you may need to convert back and forth between the two types with <code>String::as\_slice</code> or <code>&quot;&quot;.to\_string()</code>.</p>
<h3>Handling input possibilities</h3><p>Because Rust does not have a built-in concept of &quot;null&quot;, you cannot assign a non-guaranteed value to a variable. Instead,
Rust provides the Result type, which wraps the successful value in an <code>Ok()</code>-wrapped response; otherwise, an error will be 
provided with the relevant error details. </p>
<p>This means that reads from <code>STDIN</code> will be quite a bit more verbose than you&#39;re used to,
but the compiler now forces the checking of invalid situations for a value, which can take more off of your mind.</p>
<h3>Changing I/O Library</h3><p>One of the last changes to the Rust Standard Library was an overhaul of the IO subsystem. Most documentation (including the 
official docs) request that you continue to use <code>std::old_io</code> until the overhaul is complete.</p>
<h2>Memory Management</h2><p>One of the larges differences between the two languages is the presence/absence of a Garbage Collector. In Ruby (and other GC&#39;d
languages), the GC is used to clean up expired references from the runtime, to periodically free unused memory from the 
application being run.</p>
<p>In Rust, there is no GC. Instead, the compiler has a notion of &quot;ownership,&quot; as we discussed earlier. Check out the following 
snippet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">    let x = Box::new(5);
    {   
        let y = x;
    }   

    println!(&quot;x == {}&quot;, x);
</code></pre>
<p>In line 1, we create a new heap-allocated variable, and store 5 into it. Because it&#39;s on the heap, the value of x is really
a pointer to the memory location of the &quot;Box&quot; - the owned variable. Now, in line 3, we create the variable y, and store x&#39;s value 
into it; this is considered by the Rust compiler to be a &quot;move&quot; - both pointers point to the data, but rust treats y as the 
new owner of the Box, as x has transferred ownership. Because of this, line 6 fails to compile correctly, as the value owner 
has been moved:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">src/main.rs:7:25: 7:26 error: use of moved value: `x`
src/main.rs:7     println!(&quot;x == {}&quot;, x);
                                      ^
note: in expansion of format_args!
&lt;std macros&gt;:2:43: 2:76 note: expansion site
&lt;std macros&gt;:1:1: 2:78 note: in expansion of println!
src/main.rs:7:5: 7:28 note: expansion site
src/main.rs:4:13: 4:14 note: `x` moved here because it has type `Box&lt;i32&gt;`, which is moved by default
src/main.rs:4         let y = x;
                          ^
src/main.rs:4:14: 4:14 help: use `ref` to override
error: aborting due to previous error
</code></pre>
<p>Because of this, you need to keep track of what values you&#39;re using where, who&#39;s got the ownership of the value, and how long 
the value is alive. </p>
<h2>Documentation!</h2><p>This will be something that comes with more use and more exposure, but right now, outside of the <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/">Rust standard documentation</a>, there
isn&#39;t much for explanations on how/where to do things is, in comparison to the Ruby ecosystem on the Internet. As I get more
into it, I&#39;m hoping to have more posts like this, where I can go into greater detail on how to do things in a rust-like way.</p>
<p>Moving into Systems programming is weird for me; I know there&#39;s some things that I&#39;m missing, and I have a lot more power to 
play around with the system at a lower level, but I struggle with finding projects to work on. Either I choose something 
substantially big, or it ends up being examples on <a href="http://reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer">/r/dailyprogrammer</a>. I&#39;d like to put 
together something in the middle soon.</p>
