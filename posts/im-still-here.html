I&rsquo;m going to put some adequate time into resolving that this month and into the future. I&rsquo;ve been sitting on a couple of topics that I want to dig into (regarding how I handle <a href="http://notmuchmail.org">email</a> and some work I&rsquo;ve been doing with <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a>).</p>
<p>In the interim, I&rsquo;ll leave you with a little anecdote/tale of caution.</p>
<hr />
<p>My wife and I (oh yeah, by the way, I got married in April. I really need to work on updates.) frequently play video games together to pass the time. I&rsquo;m not normally terribly competitive, and she&rsquo;s not into the traditional multiplayer model of games, so I try to look for games we can play that are multiplayer co-op, or more turn-based (I&rsquo;ve gotten us both hopelessly addicted to <a href="http://www.civilization.com/">Civilization</a>).</p>
<p>Recently, with a lapse in new ideas for games, we bought her a copy of <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/sub/32848/">Borderlands 2 on Steam</a> so that we could play through the storyline together. I had played shortly after it came out, and with friends both in the Midwest and in the PNW, so I had a number of game saves on my desktop.</p>
<p><em>Complication #1</em>: When we play games, normally Jordan gets the desktop, so that she has a better experience with the game. Having already played it, I get relegated to my laptop (running integrated Intel graphics) when I play along.</p>
<p><em>Complication #2</em>:  The group that did the porting of the game to Linux (<a href="http://www.aspyr.com/">Aspyr Media</a>, who should get amazing credit for their work in extending video games to the Linux world) does not allow for Steam Cloud saves to cross platforms. As such, I had no access to the work I&rsquo;ve put into the game previously.</p>
<hr />
<p>We come to the events of tonight.</p>
<p>Jordan is away on a work trip, and Christopher is home alone. Christopher decides, &ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s been forever since I&rsquo;ve actually gotten to use my desktop for games, and I&rsquo;ve been playing BL2 recently; let&rsquo;s play that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour passes as Christopher enjoys playing one of his old characters, which is close in level to where he&rsquo;s at with Jordan.</p>
<p>Christopher: &ldquo;Hey - I should see if I can copy over the character data to the laptop, so I have the option to play with those characters when Jordan gets back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After researching, Christopher finds that the character data is saved in files called <code>save&lt;nnnn&gt;.sav</code>. Easy enough to copy from one location to the next.</p>
<p>Christopher copies the save data to a shared filesystem so he can access it on his laptop, and then fires off the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-language-bash">cp save*.sav ~/.local/share/aspyr-media/borderlands 2/willowgame/savedata/&lt;numerical id&gt;/
</code></pre>
<p>After thinking about this, Christopher realizes in horror that <em>he&rsquo;s just saved over his character data he&rsquo;s been playing with his wife for the majority of the last week</em>.</p>
<p>Because the <code>cp</code> command doesn&rsquo;t default the <code>-i/--interactive</code> option, which would prompt on overwrite, it is easy to fall into this trap. In my case, both game saves were named &ldquo;save0001.sav&rdquo;, and the <code>cp</code> call replaced my character data with the old one.</p>
<p>I scoured the Internet for methods of data recovery (there&rsquo;s a <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/211301/recovery-of-overwritten-file">really</a> <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/150423">cool</a> <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/101237/how-to-recover-files-i-deleted-now-by-running-rm">tangent</a> to take here on how mv/rm/cp actually behave), and most things I found referred to using text contained in the file to find the details. That&rsquo;d be great, but the data files for those characters are <a href="http://gaming.stackexchange.com/a/84732">encrypted</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately (for me), this story has a happy ending. Borderlands 2 has support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_%28software%29#cite_ref-39">Steam Cloud</a>. As a last-ditch effort, I removed <em>all</em> save data from the folder on the laptop, and restarted the game. Upon loading, it detected a game save within Steam Cloud that didn&rsquo;t exist locally, and happily copied that save down to the local machine. I&rsquo;m even more pleased to say that it was a recent save to, so I didn&rsquo;t lose my place!</p>
<hr />
<p>So, the moral of today&rsquo;s story: make sure you use (or better yet, alias) cp to <code>cp -i</code>, so that when you write to a directory, you pause before overwriting.</p>
