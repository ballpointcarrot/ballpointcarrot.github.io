So, I guess on 30 April 2013, Posterous Spaces was shuttered. You should see [what's there now](http://www.posterous.com).

Then, a full three months later, someone tells me that ballpointcarrot.net isn't functioning.
I figure, "I can check it when I find some time. It's been busy." 

Cue almost a *month* after that, and I find that Posterous is gone (as is the content on the old blog).
Now, I'm working to rebuild and reset different platforms/ideas that can both provide me CNAME linking
to [blog.ballpointcarrot.net](http://blog.ballpointcarrot.net), and I ran across Github Pages and Octopress.
I'm gonna give it a try for a while, and see what happens.

Meanwhile, the main ballpointcarrot site has to go through a redesign, as the automatic feed parsing thing has 
broken enough times that it's time to replace it. Expect a new look (but the same old logo) sometime when I find 
some more time again - so November, maybe. :S
